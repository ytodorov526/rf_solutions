        "To prevent fuel melting in accident scenarios"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Burnable poisons (like gadolinium or boron) are incorporated into some fuel elements to compensate for the high initial reactivity of fresh fuel. They 'burn up' (absorb neutrons and convert to non-absorbing isotopes) gradually as the fuel depletes, helping maintain relatively constant reactivity throughout the fuel cycle and allowing for longer periods between refueling."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of a neutron reflector in a nuclear reactor?",
      options: [
        "To reflect radiation away from operators",
        "To bounce neutrons back into the core to improve efficiency",

        "To prevent neutron-induced corrosion of the vessel"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A neutron reflector surrounds the reactor core and reflects neutrons that would otherwise escape back into the core. This improves fuel utilization, reduces critical mass requirements, and helps flatten the neutron flux distribution across the core. Common reflector materials include beryllium, graphite, and water."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary reason for using zirconium alloys as fuel cladding in nuclear reactors?",
      options: [
        "High melting point",
        "Low cost",
        "Low neutron absorption cross-section",
        "Good thermal conductivity"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Zirconium alloys are used as fuel cladding primarily due to their low neutron absorption cross-section, which allows more neutrons to remain available for the fission chain reaction. They also have good corrosion resistance in high-temperature water environments and adequate mechanical properties for containing the fuel and fission products."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a nuclear chain reaction and radioactive decay?",
      options: [
        "Chain reactions release more energy, while decay is more dangerous",
        "Chain reactions involve fission events triggering more fissions, while decay is spontaneous",
        "Chain reactions only occur in reactors, while decay only occurs in waste",
        "Chain reactions produce neutrons, while decay produces only gamma rays"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A nuclear chain reaction is a process where neutrons released in fission trigger additional fission events, creating a self-sustaining reaction. In contrast, radioactive decay is a spontaneous process where unstable nuclei emit radiation to reach a more stable state. Chain reactions can be controlled and are the basis of nuclear power, while decay occurs at a fixed rate determined by the radioisotope's half-life."

        "Adding burnable poisons to fresh fuel"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Enrichment is the process of increasing the concentration of the fissile isotope uranium-235 relative to the more abundant uranium-238. Natural uranium contains only 0.7% U-235, but most commercial reactors require 3-5% U-235 to sustain a chain reaction. Enrichment technologies include gaseous diffusion, gas centrifuge, and newer laser-based methods."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the main function of a steam generator in a nuclear power plant?",
      options: [
        "To generate steam directly from nuclear fission",
        "To transfer heat from the primary coolant to produce steam in the secondary loop",
        "To remove excess steam from the reactor core",
        "To generate power for the plant's internal consumption"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "In a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), the steam generator transfers heat from the high-pressure, radioactive primary coolant to the non-radioactive secondary loop, producing steam to drive the turbine. This design creates a barrier between the radioactive and non-radioactive parts of the plant, enhancing safety by preventing the release of radioactive materials to the environment."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of 'boron' in PWR primary coolant?",
      options: [
        "To prevent coolant from becoming radioactive",
        "To inhibit corrosion of the primary system",
        "To control reactivity by absorbing neutrons",
        "To improve heat transfer properties of water"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Boron (in the form of boric acid) is dissolved in the primary coolant of PWRs to control reactivity by absorbing neutrons. By adjusting boron concentration, operators can control long-term reactivity changes over the fuel cycle. This chemical shim complements control rods, allowing for more uniform power distribution and fewer control rod movements during operation."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of a cooling tower at a nuclear power plant?",
      options: [
        "To cool the reactor core directly",
        "To condense spent steam from the turbine back into water",
        "To reduce radioactivity in the primary coolant",
        "To provide emergency cooling during accidents"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Cooling towers at nuclear power plants dissipate waste heat from the power conversion cycle by cooling the condenser water that has condensed steam from the turbine. They prevent thermal pollution of natural water bodies by transferring heat to the atmosphere rather than discharging hot water directly to lakes or rivers. Cooling towers are part of the tertiary loop and don't interact with radioactive systems."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the main difference between a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) and a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)?",
      options: [
        "PWRs use uranium fuel, while BWRs use plutonium",
        "PWRs have higher power output than BWRs",
        "In PWRs, water in the primary loop doesn't boil; in BWRs, it does",
        "PWRs have containment buildings, while BWRs don't"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The key difference between PWRs and BWRs is that in PWRs, water in the primary cooling loop (in contact with the core) is kept under pressure to prevent boiling, and a separate secondary loop generates steam. In BWRs, water is allowed to boil directly in the core, and the resulting steam is sent directly to the turbine. Both use similar fuel and have containment buildings."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of a nuclear fuel pellet's central void?",
      options: [
        "To reduce the amount of uranium needed",
        "To allow for fuel expansion and accommodate fission gases",
        "To create a path for control rod insertion",
        "To allow coolant to flow through the fuel"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The central void (or 'plenum') in nuclear fuel pellets provides space to accommodate thermal expansion of the fuel and the buildup of fission gases released during operation. Without this void, excessive pressure could build up inside the fuel rod, potentially leading to cladding failure. The void also helps reduce the centerline temperature of the fuel by decreasing the conduction path length."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the three primary 'barriers' designed to prevent radioactive release in nuclear power plants?",
      options: [
        "Containment building, reactor vessel, and turbine building",
        "Fuel cladding, reactor coolant system, and containment building",
        "Control rods, coolant, and concrete shielding",
        "Fuel enrichment, waste storage, and site boundary"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Nuclear power plants use a 'defense in depth' approach with three primary barriers to prevent radioactive release: 1) the fuel cladding, which contains the fuel and fission products; 2) the reactor coolant system pressure boundary, including the reactor vessel; and 3) the containment building, designed to contain radioactive materials if the first two barriers fail."

        "Thorium-232",
        "Helium-3 and Hydrogen-1"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Most commercial fusion reactor designs plan to use deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H) as fuel. This combination has the highest reaction cross-section at achievable temperatures. Deuterium can be extracted from seawater, while tritium is radioactive with a short half-life and would need to be bred in the reactor using lithium. The fusion of these isotopes produces helium, a neutron, and significant energy."

        "To prevent biological contamination of the reactor core",
        "To contain biological research specimens near the reactor"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The biological shield is a thick layer of dense material (usually concrete, sometimes with steel or lead) that surrounds the reactor vessel to protect plant workers and equipment from radiation exposure. It attenuates both neutron and gamma radiation that escapes the reactor vessel. The biological shield is distinct from the containment structure, which serves to prevent release of radioactive materials to the environment."

    {
      question: "What is the difference between 'contamination' and 'irradiation'?",
      options: [
        "Contamination is from natural sources, irradiation is artificial",
        "Contamination affects only living tissue, irradiation affects any material",
        "Contamination involves radioactive material on/in an object, irradiation is exposure to radiation without material transfer",
        "Contamination is temporary, irradiation causes permanent changes"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Contamination occurs when radioactive material is deposited on or incorporated into an object or person. The object becomes a radiation source. Irradiation is exposure to radiation without the transfer of radioactive material, like getting an X-ray. An irradiated person is not radioactive, but a contaminated person is both irradiated by and a source of radiation."

      question: "What is the difference between prompt and delayed criticality?",
      options: [
        "Prompt criticality relies only on prompt neutrons, while delayed criticality includes delayed neutrons",
        "Prompt criticality occurs immediately, while delayed criticality takes hours to achieve",
        "Prompt criticality happens at higher power levels, delayed at lower levels",
        "Prompt criticality relates to research reactors, delayed to power reactors"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Prompt criticality means the reactor would be critical using only prompt neutrons (neutrons released immediately during fission). This is an unsafe condition leading to a rapid power excursion. Normal reactor operation relies on delayed criticality, where both prompt and delayed neutrons are needed for criticality, allowing for controllable operation."

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Xenon poisoning refers to the accumulation of xenon-135 (a fission product with an extremely high neutron absorption cross-section) in an operating reactor. After a power reduction, xenon-135 continues to accumulate from iodine-135 decay, causing a temporary decrease in reactivity that can prevent restart for several hours. This phenomenon complicates load-following operations and was a factor in the Chernobyl accident."

        "The temperature at which a reactor becomes critical"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The reactivity temperature coefficient describes how reactor reactivity changes with temperature variations. A negative coefficient (which is desirable) means reactivity decreases as temperature increases, providing an inherent safety mechanism. This occurs through effects like Doppler broadening in fuel and density changes in the moderator. A negative coefficient helps stabilize reactor operation by counteracting power excursions through natural feedback."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Fuel shuffling is the practice of relocating fuel assemblies to different positions in the core during refueling outages. Partially burned fuel from high-flux regions is moved to lower-flux regions, while fresh fuel is placed in high-flux regions. This optimizes fuel utilization, flattens power distribution, and extends cycle length by positioning each assembly where its remaining reactivity can be best utilized."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Neutron fluence is the time-integrated neutron flux, representing the total number of neutrons that have passed through a unit area over time. In reactor pressure vessels, high-energy neutron fluence causes embrittlement by creating lattice defects that reduce the material's ductility and increase its ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. This is a limiting factor in plant lifetime and is carefully monitored through surveillance programs."

      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "A station blackout (SBO) is the complete loss of both offsite AC power and emergency onsite AC power (backup diesel generators). This is a serious condition as many critical safety systems rely on AC power. Plants have coping strategies for SBO including battery-powered DC systems, alternate AC sources, and passive cooling methods. The Fukushima accident in 2011 demonstrated the severe consequences of an extended station blackout."

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The point kinetics equation is a simplified mathematical model that describes the time-dependent behavior of reactor power in response to reactivity changes. It treats the reactor as a 'point' (spatially uniform) and accounts for both prompt and delayed neutrons. While it neglects spatial effects, it provides reasonably accurate results for many transients and is widely used in reactor control system design and safety analyses."

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The hot channel factor (or peaking factor) is a measure of how much hotter the most severely heated fuel channel is compared to the core average. It accounts for manufacturing tolerances, operational variations, and design uncertainties. Nuclear plants maintain margins to safety limits by ensuring that even the hot channel remains below critical heat flux conditions during normal operation and anticipated operational occurrences."

        "The peak temperature in the reflector material"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The reflector peak is a localized increase in neutron flux (and power density) that occurs near the interface between the reactor core and the reflector. It happens because neutrons that would otherwise escape are reflected back into the core, causing higher reaction rates in fuel elements near the boundary. This phenomenon must be accounted for in power distribution calculations and thermal margin assessments."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The Chernobyl accident was primarily caused by the RBMK reactor's positive void coefficient combined with a positive graphite coefficient. As coolant water vaporized, it increased reactivity rather than decreasing it. When control rods with graphite tips were inserted from fully withdrawn positions, they initially displaced water with graphite (a better moderator), temporarily increasing reactivity before the absorber sections entered the core - a design flaw called the 'positive scram effect'."

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Defense in depth is a fundamental nuclear safety principle that involves implementing multiple independent and redundant layers of protection, so if one layer fails, others remain effective. These include physical barriers (fuel cladding, pressure vessel, containment) and diverse safety systems. The concept recognizes that no single safety feature should be relied upon exclusively."

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Fuel burn-up is a measure of the energy extracted from nuclear fuel, typically expressed in gigawatt-days per metric ton of uranium (GWd/tU). It represents how much of the original fissile material has been 'burned' through nuclear reactions. Higher burn-up means more efficient fuel utilization but also leads to greater fuel cladding stress and fission product inventory."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Thermal neutrons (<0.025 eV, corresponding to room temperature) are most effective at causing fission in U-235. The fission cross-section for U-235 is much higher (about 500 barns) for thermal neutrons than for fast neutrons (about 1-2 barns). This is why most commercial reactors use moderators to thermalize neutrons."

        "Deterministic analyses are conducted before construction, probabilistic during operation"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Deterministic safety analyses examine specific accident scenarios (often worst-case) to ensure safety systems can prevent or mitigate consequences, regardless of probability. Probabilistic safety analyses (PSA) quantify the likelihood of different accident sequences and their consequences, identifying risk contributors. Modern safety approaches use both: deterministic to ensure adequate safety margins and probabilistic to optimize safety resources toward the most significant risks."

        "The ratio of fissions caused by delayed versus prompt neutrons"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The breeding ratio is the ratio of new fissile material produced (through conversion of fertile material like U-238 to Pu-239) to fissile material consumed in the reactor. A breeding ratio greater than 1 means the reactor produces more fissile material than it consumes, theoretically enabling a sustainable fuel cycle with improved uranium resource utilization."

        "Reactivity decreases as fuel and moderator temperature increase",
        "The control system reduces power when temperature rises too high"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "A negative temperature coefficient means that as reactor temperature increases, reactivity decreases automatically. This provides inherent safety and stability, as any unintended temperature rise (from excess power) causes a reduction in reactivity that counteracts the original disturbance. It comes from physical effects like Doppler broadening in fuel and density reduction in moderators."

        "To use natural uranium without enrichment",
        "To increase thermal efficiency",
        "To reduce radioactive waste production"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Heavy water is primarily used because it has a much lower neutron absorption cross-section than light water, allowing reactors to achieve criticality with natural uranium (0.7% U-235) without enrichment. Light water reactors require enriched uranium (3-5% U-235) because ordinary hydrogen absorbs too many neutrons. This design choice was particularly important for countries that lacked uranium enrichment technology."

        "To increase the boiling point of the secondary coolant"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The pressurizer maintains primary coolant pressure and compensates for volume changes in a PWR. It contains both water and steam phases in equilibrium, with heaters and spray systems to raise or lower pressure as needed. This ensures the primary coolant remains liquid throughout the system despite temperature changes, preventing boiling in the core while allowing efficient heat transfer to the secondary system."

        "Corrosion of primary coolant system components by xenon"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Xenon poisoning refers to the buildup of xenon-135, which has an extremely high neutron absorption cross-section, in an operating reactor. After a power reduction, xenon-135 (produced from iodine-135 decay) continues to accumulate, causing a temporary decrease in reactivity that can make restart difficult for several hours. This phenomenon complicates load-following operations and played a role in the Chernobyl accident."

        "Generating hydrogen through sodium-water reactions"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs) utilize fast neutrons without moderation for the fission chain reaction, while using liquid sodium as the coolant. Sodium's excellent heat transfer properties allow efficient cooling without slowing neutrons. These reactors can breed new fuel and potentially transmute long-lived waste, but present challenges including sodium's chemical reactivity with water and air."

        "To dilute radioactive materials before disposal"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Spent fuel pools store and cool fuel assemblies after they're removed from the reactor. The water provides both cooling (removing decay heat) and radiation shielding. Typically, fuel remains in these pools for at least 5-10 years before potential transfer to dry cask storage. The pools are designed with multiple cooling systems, radiation monitoring, and are typically housed in robust structures."

        "A facility for capturing radioactive iodine released during accidents",
        "The location where iodine filters are installed in the ventilation system"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The iodine pit refers to a period of minimum reactivity occurring about 9 hours after reactor shutdown, caused by the decay of iodine-135 into xenon-135 (a strong neutron absorber). While iodine-135 decays (half-life ~6.7 hours), xenon-135 continues to build up faster than it decays (half-life ~9.2 hours) until reaching equilibrium. This can prevent reactor restart for several hours after shutdown."

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Passive safety systems are designed to function without operator intervention, AC power, or active components like pumps. They rely on natural forces such as gravity, natural circulation, convection, or stored energy in batteries or compressed gases. These systems can provide cooling, pressure control, or containment functions during accidents, enhancing plant safety by reducing reliance on human actions and active components that could fail."

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Thermal margin refers to the distance between actual operating parameters and safety limits established to prevent fuel damage. Parameters like Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) or Critical Power Ratio (CPR) quantify this margin. Maintaining adequate thermal margin ensures that even during transients or accidents, the core remains sufficiently cooled and fuel integrity is preserved.

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The alpha-to-beta transformation is a crystalline phase change in uranium metal from the orthorhombic alpha phase to the tetragonal beta phase, occurring at about 668°C. This transformation involves a significant volume change and anisotropic growth that can cause distortion and cracking in uranium metal fuel. This limitation led to the adoption of uranium dioxide (UO₂) as the preferred fuel form for most commercial reactors."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Critical Heat Flux (CHF) represents the thermal limit beyond which there is a sudden deterioration in heat transfer efficiency due to the transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling. When this occurs on fuel rod surfaces, cladding temperatures can rise rapidly (departure from nucleate boiling in PWRs or dryout in BWRs), potentially leading to fuel damage. Maintaining margin to CHF is a fundamental safety requirement in reactor design and operation."

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Regional Overpower Protection (ROP) is a safety system in CANDU reactors that uses in-core detectors to monitor and protect against localized power excursions that could lead to fuel damage. The core is divided into zones with dedicated detectors, and the system will trigger a reactor trip if power in any zone exceeds safety limits. This is particularly important in large cores where power distribution can vary significantly across different regions."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The neutron wave concept (or traveling wave reactor) involves a wave of breeding and burning that slowly moves through the fuel over time. Starting with a small active region of fissile material surrounded by fertile material (like U-238), the neutrons breed new fuel (Pu-239) just ahead of the burning region, creating a self-sustaining wave that gradually progresses through the core over many years, potentially allowing decades of operation without refueling."

      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "The decay heat fraction is the percentage of the reactor's rated thermal power that continues to be generated after shutdown due to radioactive decay of fission products. Immediately after shutdown, decay heat is typically about 7% of full power, decreasing to about 1% after an hour and 0.5% after a day. Managing this decay heat is crucial for preventing fuel damage following shutdown, as demonstrated by accidents like Fukushima."

        "Manufacturing variations in fuel enrichment"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Xenon-induced spatial oscillations occur because local power changes affect xenon production and burnout rates differently. If power increases in one region, xenon initially builds up (from iodine decay), then burns out. Adjacent regions experience the opposite effect, creating out-of-phase xenon concentrations. In large cores, this can lead to power swinging from one region to another with a period of about 15-30 hours unless properly controlled."

Neutron bombardment displaces carbon atoms from their lattice positions, storing potential energy. This energy can be released spontaneously if the graphite reaches a critical temperature, potentially causing rapid temperature excursions. This phenomenon contributed to the 1957 Windscale fire in the UK."

This reactivity deficit must be compensated for in the initial core design by incorporating excess reactivity (through higher enrichment, burnable absorbers, etc.) to achieve the desired cycle length."

      question: "What does the 'Sievert integral' calculate in radiation shielding analysis?",
      options: [
        "The total radiation dose in Sieverts received by workers",
        "The line-of-sight integral of gamma ray attenuation through shields",
        "The cumulative effect of different radiation types weighted by their biological effectiveness",
        "The integral of radiation streaming through shield penetrations"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The Sievert integral (or exposure buildup factor) is used in gamma ray shielding calculations to account for scattered radiation. It represents the line-of-sight integral of gamma ray attenuation through a shield, accounting for both primary (unscattered) and secondary (scattered) radiation. This approach helps properly size radiation shields, as considering only primary radiation would significantly underestimate dose rates behind the shield."

      question: "What is 'pin cell homogenization' in reactor physics calculations?",
      options: [
        "A manufacturing process to ensure uniform distribution of uranium in fuel pins",
        "A computational technique that smears fuel, gap, and cladding into equivalent homogeneous materials",
        "The physical mixing of different materials in experimental fuel pins",
        "A quality control measure to verify uniform fuel enrichment"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Pin cell homogenization is a computational technique in reactor physics that replaces the heterogeneous structure of a fuel pin (fuel, gap, cladding) with equivalent homogeneous materials that preserve reaction rates. This simplification allows more efficient whole-core calculations while maintaining adequate accuracy. It typically involves detailed transport calculations at the pin level to generate homogenized cross-sections for use in larger-scale models."

      question: "What is 'subcritical multiplication' in nuclear systems?",
      options: [
        "The increase in neutron population when a subcritical system approaches criticality",
        "A technique for extracting energy from subcritical assemblies",
        "The mathematical formula for calculating subcritical reactivity",
        "The process of breeding fissile material in subcritical blankets"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "Subcritical multiplication refers to the increase in neutron population when an external neutron source is present in a subcritical system. As the system approaches criticality (k approaches 1), the multiplication factor M = 1/(1-k) grows larger, amplifying the source neutrons. This phenomenon is the basis for subcritical reactivity measurements, startup neutron monitoring, and accelerator-driven subcritical system operation."

      question: "What is the 'Nordheim-Fuchs model' used for in nuclear engineering?",
      options: [
        "Modeling reactor behavior during control rod movements",
        "Analyzing prompt criticality excursions",
        "Calculating neutron absorption in fuel rods",
        "Predicting staff radiation dose during normal operation"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The Nordheim-Fuchs model is a simplified analytical model used to analyze the behavior of prompt critical excursions and their self-limitation due to negative temperature feedback. It predicts the power trace, energy release, and maximum temperature during such events. While simplified, it provides important insights into criticality safety and accident analysis, particularly for research reactors, criticality accidents, and pulse reactors."

      question: "What is 'mesh refinement study' in nuclear computational modeling?",
      options: [
        "Improving the quality of metal wire meshes in fuel assemblies",
        "Analyzing the effect of mesh size on computational accuracy and convergence",
        "A study of radiation shielding effectiveness of different mesh materials",
        "Refinement of containment spray mesh patterns for optimal coverage"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A mesh refinement study systematically analyzes how computational solution accuracy depends on the spatial discretization (mesh) used. By performing calculations with progressively finer meshes, engineers can establish convergence behavior, estimate discretization error, and determine the appropriate mesh density for achieving desired accuracy. This is crucial in safety-critical nuclear simulations involving neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, or structural mechanics."

      question: "What is a 'Bonner sphere spectrometer' used for in nuclear engineering?",
      options: [
        "Measuring the energy spectrum of neutrons",
        "Analyzing spherical fuel pellet properties",
        "Determining the sphericity of containment structures",
        "Testing bond strength between fuel and cladding"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: "A Bonner sphere spectrometer is an instrument used to measure neutron energy spectra. It consists of a thermal neutron detector surrounded by moderating polyethylene spheres of different diameters. Each sphere configuration has different response functions to neutrons of various energies. By measuring counts with different sphere sizes and applying unfolding algorithms, the neutron energy spectrum can be determined, which is important for radiation protection and shielding design."
