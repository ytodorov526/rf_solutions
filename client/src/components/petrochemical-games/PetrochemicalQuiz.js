        "Weeping",
        "Flooding"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Flooding occurs in distillation columns when the upward vapor velocity becomes so high that it prevents liquid from flowing downward through the column. This can happen at very high reflux ratios (high liquid and vapor traffic) and results in severely reduced separation efficiency. At very low reflux ratios, other issues like poor wetting of contact surfaces can also reduce efficiency."
    }
