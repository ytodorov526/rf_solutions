## Deployment

### Azure Web App Deployment with GitHub Actions
This project is configured for automated deployment to Azure Web App using GitHub Actions with user-assigned managed identity:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Create an Azure Web App service in your Azure Portal (with Node.js 22)
   - Configure a user-assigned managed identity in Azure
   - Set up the following GitHub repository secrets:
     - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of your user-assigned managed identity
     - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Your Azure tenant ID
     - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Your Azure subscription ID
     - `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME`: The name of your Azure Web App

2. **Deployment Process:**
   - Push or merge to the master branch will trigger automated deployment
   - GitHub Actions will build the React client, install server dependencies, and deploy to Azure
   - Authentication uses secure user-assigned managed identity instead of publish profiles
   - The workflow configuration is located in `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`

### Manual Deployment

#### Backend
1. Set up your environment variables on your hosting platform
2. Build and deploy the Node.js application

#### Frontend
1. Build the production version:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your web server
